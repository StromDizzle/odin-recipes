        <h3>Directions:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a pot, insert however much rice you plan to cook based on how many filets you are cooking. For example, if you are cooking 3 filets, you will need 1 1/2 cups of rice.</li>
            <li>Take the amount of rice you are cooking, double that amount, then add that much water to the pot. If you are cooking 1 1/2 cups of rice, you will add 3 cups of water.</li>
            <li>Add 1/4 stick of butter to the pot with the rice and water, add salt to taste.</li>
            <li>Bring pot to a rolling boil, then lower the heat so that the water is at a simmer, then start a timer for 10 minutes. It is important not to start the timer until you have brought the rice to a boil. That's it for the rice! Now on to the salmon!</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Line a baking pan with aluminum foil, then place all salmon filets in the baking pan.</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper both sides of the salmon filets.</li>
            <li>In a small bowl, melt 1/4-1/2 stick of butter, then mix in garlic or garlic paste. I usually use about a tablespoon, but this is based on preference.</li>
            <li>Using a spoon, cover the salmon filets with the garlic butter mixture.</li>
            <li>Bake @ 400 for 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>Plate the salmon and rice and enjoy!</li>
